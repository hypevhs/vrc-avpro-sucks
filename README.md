# vrc-avpro-sucks

This is a program that runs in the background while you play VRChat on Linux. If you are in a world with a recognized
video player, this program will open `mpv` and, based on the information coming from VRChat's log file, forward commands
to `mpv` in order to keep the video synced with what you'd expect to see ingame.
